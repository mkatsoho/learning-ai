This is a list of all my recommended materials for AI, base on my learning experience since 2024 Spring. If you think they are helpful, continue your learning and share them to others.  

## Learning Path and the most recommended materials

- Artificial Intellegence (AI)

Dr. Alice Gao's CS 486/686 courses in Uwaterloo. The most clear lectures I met! It brings the first step for high school student to start his/her AI voyger. She provides video, slides and even nodes.

- Machine learning (ML)

StatQuest - a long (100 epsodes)  but step-by-step tutorial for college studentds, from the basic concept to CNN and Transformer. Just a heads up, it beats 95% instructers and professors in colleges.

- Deep learning (DL)

The deep learning course, mainly for computer vision (CV), is by Fei Fei Li's team. Many professors deliver their DL course with many references on this. The only pitfall is its focus is only on CV.

## Other strongly recommended materials

Python for machine learning (not cover Neural Network)  

Chinese book: 李烨 机器学习极简入门 (本书较难买到，可以去国家图书馆借阅) This book gives clear explainations on those used math fomulas.
